  "body": "### Summary\r\nThere are three Sheets: Users, Groups and User-Groups. User-Groups is a pivot table created from the first two Sheets. User-Groups is updated every minute.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n#### Flow\r\nI think the easiest way to show what is going on is through a diagram.\r\nI'll give you a high level diagram and a digram with code snippets.\r\n\r\n#### Service Account\r\nFor this demo I used an existing Service Account for the sake of keeping it as simple as possible. Let me know if you want more details on that part.\r\n#### Python Code\r\nThe code is sitting on my local server. To view the full code go HERE.\r\nThis script is run once every minute through the use of cron.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go baheck to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
